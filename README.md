# LED-Chaser
A simple LED chaser board using a 555 IC. Ten LEDs will blink in sequence. I created a custom PCB in KICAD, based on a ten-pointed flower design. I created this by following the hackclub tutorial at this link: <a href="https://blueprint.hackclub.com/starter-projects/blinky">https://blueprint.hackclub.com/starter-projects/blinky</a>. All custom design was created in affinity designer. The board is powered by an external battery with pin connectors.

This project is one of my first hardware projects without a microcontroller, and I created it to improve my KICAD skills and gain more experience soldering, as all the parts are through-hole components. I hope that the soldering process goes smoothly!
